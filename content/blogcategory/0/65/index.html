We support such organizations as they respond to communities in immediate distress, and we help expand their long-term capacity by encouraging the innovative integration of technology into their operational strategies. </p>   <p> The result? Nonprofits reach new levels of productivity, and chronic intervention steadily gives way to lasting transformation. That's what sets our philanthropy apart.
