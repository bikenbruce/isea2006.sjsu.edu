The etoy.INVESTORS own, feed, control and protect the legendary corporate sculpture to scan and expand the boundaries of contemporary art and to breed value on a higher level of human intelligence. etoy does not sell isolated art objects. etoy sells, trades and exchanges parts of itself: The etoy.SHARES represent participation and cultural value.
