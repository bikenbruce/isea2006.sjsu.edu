			<h2>FIRST-TIME AWARDS PRESENTED AT ZEROONE SAN JOSE</h2>  <h3>Artists, Technologists, Media Theorists, Curators and Hundreds of Others Turn Out at San Jose City Hall for Presentation</h3>  <p align="left"> SAN JOSE, CA (August 11, 2006) &ndash; Two prestigious, first-time awards were handed out this week at the opening ceremonies of ZeroOne San Jose: A Global Festival of Art on the Edge. Held this week in conjunction with the 13th International Symposium on Electronic Arts, ZeroOne San Jose showcases the work of approximately 200 artists from 24 countries. </p>  <p align="left"> Lynn Hershman Leeson received the first ZeroOne San Jose &quot;Innovation that Matters Award,&quot; sponsored by IBM. The award of $7,500 acknowledges her career work. Some of Hershman&rsquo;s work is in the <a target="_self" class="headlineLink" href="../../../blogcategory/170/128/index.html">Edge Conditions</a> show at the San Jose Museum of Art. </p>  <p align="left"> <img vspace="5" hspace="20" border="0" align="left" src="../../../../images/artwork/acclair.jpg" />  <a target="_self" href="../../262/48/index.html">Luther Thie</a> and <a target="_self" class="headlineLink" href="../../586/48/index.html">Eyal Fried</a> received the first ZeroOne San Jose &quot;Emerging Artist Award,&quot; sponsored by Adobe. The $5,000 award is for <a target="_self" href="../../263/49/index.html">Acclair</a>, which is currently showing in the  City Hall Rotunda.  </p> <p align="left"> The jury for the Emerging Artists Award consisted of Christiane Paul, Adjunct Curator of New Media Arts at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Deborah Lawler-Dormer, Director of the Moving Image Centre in Auckland, New Zealand, and Adriane Wortzel, a leading new media artist based in New York. </p>  <p align="left"> The members of the jury were &quot;convinced by the attention to detail in both the conceptual development and implementation of <em>Acclair's</em> corporate identity; the project's level of criticality with regard to issues of data processing and security, and its transgressive qualities, which, in their 'perversity,' reflect on the interconnection of security, marketing, and consumerism in our world of increasing dataveillance.&quot; </p> <p align="left"> The jury also awarded Honorary Mention awards to <a target="_self" href="../../159/49/index.html"><em>PigeonBlog</em></a> by Beatriz da Costa with Cina Hazegh and Kevin Ponto and <a target="_blank" href="../../409/49/index.html"><em>SimVeillance</em></a> by Katharine Isbister and Rainey Straus (on view through November 26 at the San Jose Museum of Art). </p>  <p align="left"> A &quot;People's Choice Award,&quot; sponsored by the City of San Jose, was awarded on Saturday to Julian Bleecker for <a target="_self" href="../../408/49/index.html">wifi.ArtCache</a>. Voters cast their ballot via text message on a mobile phone: text &ldquo;PC&rdquo; + the Artwork Code listed in the Metro insert to 47647. There is no charge to vote, but text-messaging rates do apply. The People&rsquo;s Choice Award is $2,500 cash. </p><h2>About the Artists</h2> <p align="left"> <strong>Lynn Hershman Leeson</strong> has worked extensively in photography, video, film, installation and pioneered interactive computer and net-based media art. Her groundbreaking work has earned her numerous international awards including a tribute and retrospective from the San Francisco International Film Festival (1994), the ZKM/Seimens Media Art Award (1995), a Sundance Institute Screenwriting Fellowship (1998), the Flintridge Foundation Award for Lifetime Achievement in the visual Arts (1998), the prestigious Golden Nica in Interactive Arts from Ars Electronica (The Difference Engine #3, 1999), the World Technology Network Award for Innovation in the Visual Arts (2002), and the Award for Positive Innovations in Media from the Digital Media and Arts Association (2005). She recently received a National Endowment for the Arts grant for a forthcoming documentary film on the history of feminist art. </p>  <p align="left"> <strong>Luther Thie</strong> vacillates between art projects and motion graphics and interactive for the web. He has been a web designer and art director for the past 11 years. Luther has a BFA from UCLA, an MFA from San Francisco State, and he recently completed a Masters in Interaction Design from the Interaction Design Institute, Ivrea, Italy where his project Acclair originated. Luther specializes in interactive motion graphics integrating Flash and video into elegant online experiences. His most recent project was an interactive tour for Wells Fargo in remembrance of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. For Acclair, Luther designed and directed the creation of multiple media including user interface, website, promotional videos, costume, props and brand development. His current interests include creating motion graphics and web-based UI for the growing participatory model of media creation. Luther is also experimenting with mashups of web services using Flickr, Yahoo!, and Google APIs, using this information as raw material for motion graphics and other web-based services. </p>  <p align="left"> <strong>Eyal Fried</strong> graduated from the postgraduate program at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII), Ivrea, Italy. He is currently teaching at the Shenkar Design and Engineering Academy and the Holon Institute of Technology, and is a co-founder of the B-Lab, an Interaction Design experimental initiative.

Nearly 200 juried artists from around the world have converged on Silicon Valley to showcase some of the most innovative, astounding art ever seen or experienced. It is a multi-dimensional, startling and brilliant event featuring exhibits, live cinema, performances, workshops, and youth activities. All are one-of-a-kind, many never-before, only-here experiences. </p>  <p align="left"> Sponsored by Adobe, Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems, San Jose State University, IBM, Hewlett and Packard Foundations, Knight Ridder, Comerica Bank, IDEO, Hotel Montgomery, HP, NEC and others, this is the inaugural year for ZeroOne San Jose, which is scheduled to take place biannually.
