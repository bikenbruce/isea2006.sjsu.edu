The aim is to create digital expressions and capture local tones of urban space and environment in a digital project consisting of a series of artistically modified pictures along with sounds of their cities. This will help young people to form an understanding of their environments and could further contribute to their participation in the community development process. The project will also engage them in a creative process, by which the computer is used to stimulate aesthetic appreciation, but also plays a role in education and entertainment, as well as the shaping of our environments. There will be 20 San Francisco Bay Area and 20 international teen groups, led by a highly-experienced international moderator, who will follow step-by-step lessons plans in order o create a project that will be on display in the Education Lounge at the ZeroOne San Jose Festival, in addition to a screening and reception given during the festival. Participating groups will have easy access to the online resources of the programmes. This program continues with a second tier of opportunity, where 10 local youth and 10 international youth will be chosen from the participating groups to be a Youth Ambassador representative at the Festival. This is a cultural and artistic exchange program for one week during the festival that includes art &amp; technology workshops, receptions and activities, based on the work completed in Scenes and Sounds of My City. Information pertaining to this segment of the project will be shared with participating groups in the summer. </p> 					 <h3>UNESCO Program Criteria:</h3> <strong>1.
